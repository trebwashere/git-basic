What is the difference between add, commit, and push?

git add:
add allows you to add a file (or all files if -A is used) that are unchecked within the working directory, which will be put into the staging area once this command is executed.

git commit:
commit allows you to update your local branch/image with the staged files/changes that were in your staging area, which can be complimented by adding a commit message (using -m and inputting your message between double quotes), these changes will only remain on your local branch until you push these changes to the origin branch in the git repository.

git push:
push allows you to get all of the changes/commits done on your local copy/branch that the origin branch is not yet aware of (usually when your local branch has newer changes) and updates the origin/remote branch, it can be put as uploading your local branch image to the remote repository.
